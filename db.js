Sembène saw cinema as a popular information system in the service of education, aesthetic experience, and public dissemination.

In some cases, an exhibition is the culmination of a sets of elaborate activities, in some other cases it is a setting for further research, in some others it is a setting for hosting workshops, and in some others it is a thesis, etc. All together, leading to the exhibition are interior activities, and the exhibition is a space to meet the rest, to meet the outside: if we retain the notion of rest as a sensibility of attending to what is to come. Indeed, the distinction between action and passivity is not what is at stake in “my” exhibitions. I am now speaking from South Korea; I am here on the occasion of the Gwangju Biennale. The entry of my contribution in the exhibition catalogue speaks of these exhibition activities as also restful activities: watching movies, debating, reading, eating, drinking, workshopping, finding solutions, talking to strangers and friends, etc. All these activities can be ways of resting. Resting compels self-determination, it makes it possible to inhabit oneself with or without a goal in mind.^^CHRISTIAN NYAMPETA$$https://www.on-curating.org/issue-36-reader/how-to-rest-together.html#.YI9hFmYzbq0",
	    "<span class='question-1'>BANNISTER: Do you enjoy these protracted interpersonal exchanges? Or would you prefer to work quickly, with relative anonymity? (When I ask this, I am not thinking of works like Darkroom where the relationship with roadworkers was crucial to the preparation of materials, their labour a fundamental element of the final work.)</span>GOWDA: The wholesale market world as a daily routine is so different from mine. <span class='serif'>I enjoy watching how they work,</span> their own sense of order or seeming disorder—usually there are very good reasons for the way they do things—I enjoy the sensuality of a shop overflowing with varied things, each item seen in multiplicity creating amazing configurations. It is so enriching for the eyes, nose, ears, touch.</span> I find shopping in Europe or the US quite uninspiring compared to this. You need to know what you want and then you find it in its rightful place. <span class='serif'>There are no surprises. Having said this, ‘finding’ is not incidental; it is not the beginning.</span> Finding is about recognising something. You recognise it because you are looking for something that is relevant to the constant dialogue you are having within yourself about concepts and things around you. These encounters are catalyst moments, when the world out there presents you something that finds a resonance within you. Sometimes the encounter happens first and you go back to it later when a conceptual framework has been formulated.^^SHEELA GOWDA$$",
	    "<span class='question-1'>BANNISTER: I’d like to talk about materials. You’ve noted that you always source art materials yourself, that it’s difficult to delegate as handling materials enables you to understand both their potential and their limitations. I wonder, are there [other] unseen parts of your practice that are <span class='serif'>collaborative in some way, that rely on other people?</span> GOWDA: Of course there are other people helping me—sometimes officially acknowledged if their input is specific or very substantial. [...] To my understanding, collaboration does not mean mere assistance, paid or unpaid. [...] Collaboration is when the other person brings in a thinking that influences the direction and nature of your work, and here too opinions and feedback cannot be called collaboration. Most often, I use materials or ready products in the market where the skill of the person who has made it by hand is evident—<span class='serif'>the acknowledgement comes in my recognition of this process and the very reason that I pick it up and use it.</span> The small wooden figurines that I used in Of All People [and] the hair ropes used in Behold are some examples of unseen hands.^^SHEELA GOWDA$$http://laurabannister.com/selected-writings/an-email-thread-with-sheela-gowda/",
	    "<span class='question-1'>NM: In your work and life, you have always taken the opposite approach, committing to a deep investigation of your own complex cultural background and finding commonalities between different traditions. In art, this is what expands lateral thinking; at the same time, in the past this approach caused you troubles, shocking audiences with a more monolithic worldview and beliefs.</span>A: You know in the 90s I made this work called Lingga-Yoni that created problems with the radical groups of Muslims in Indonesia. They misunderstood it – or perhaps they didn’t want to understand. It was based on the ancient Hindu Buddhist philosophy which in a way I inherited from my ancestors. My struggle to connect ancient traditions with science and technology inevitably gets through my artwork. <span class='serif'>Lately I have gotten closer to Buddhism, but this isn’t about changing religion for me. I see the essence of all religions being basically the same; it is for the good of people of this earth.</span> But of course there are different cultural contexts and different ways of doing it. I don’t make a big deal about it, I’m more interested in the idea of pluralism, respecting the differences.^^ARAHMAIANI FEISAL$$https://www.cobosocial.com/dossiers/arahmaiani-superheroine-of-indonesian-contemporary-art/",
	    "<span class='question-1'>NM: It’s interesting to see the evolution of your artistic practice, from denouncing social and political issues, to step in and becoming part of the solution.</span>A: That’s right. Because in the past I have been questioning, questioning and protesting and criticizing. <span class='serif'>But ultimately, who is it going to answer? Not the authority. In fact, that almost never happened. I realized the most realistic thing was to answer to the problem myself. You have to try to give an answer, rather than limiting yourself to questioning and criticizing.</span> In a way, through the answer you also express a critique, but in a subtler way, through action. As an activist, you can of course be manipulated, so the trap is always there. But by going more directly into a solution, you get something more real which can’t be manipulated so easily by other people’s agendas. The important thing is that it never becomes us against them. When it becomes all about defeating your enemy, you lose sight of the change you want to see in the world. That’s what I’ve learned from my experience anyway.^^ARAHMAIANI FEISAL$$https://www.cobosocial.com/dossiers/arahmaiani-superheroine-of-indonesian-contemporary-art/",
	    " “...I presented Intervention: Indigo, a project that combines procession, performance, dance, music, textile arts, costuming, ritual, improvised interactions with the audience, and protest. It began at the Bushwick police precinct. <span class='serif'>The work is a call to action to serve and protect—and a protest in response to the violence and murder at the hands of the police of Black people</span> living in this country and all over the world. <span class='serif'>The point of departure is the color indigo, a dye that is used around the globe and associated with protection, wisdom, and royalty</span>. For example, in Burkina Faso, newborn babies are wrapped in indigo-dyed cloth to protect them. And I do not think it is a coincidence that indigo is the color of police uniforms here in the US, and almost all around the globe. It is a color imbedded with great meaning. [...] Through the act of intervention, we exercise our right to occupy public space, and in doing so, express our defiance as we symbolically appropriate what is ours and demand protection. We do this while wearing the color that symbolizes care and service but also the repression of QTBIPOC communities.”^^LAURA ANDERSON BARBATA$$https://post.moma.org/making-waves-a-conversation-with-laura-anderson-barbata/",
	    "“To simultaneously announce her arrival, in January 2008, and ingratiate herself among villagers, Shiga passed out flyers that read: “Pleased to meet you. My name is Lieko Shiga. I have rented a space in the pines next to the Kitakama Pool … I am a photographer, and I usually travel around to various places and take photos. This will be my center of activities for the new year…. I will do my best to serve you.” She became the local community photographer. In this role, she documented everything from baseball games to town hall meetings, as well as festivals and ceremonies on the verge of dying with members of the aging population. She made portraits that villagers could give to family members or use for their own funeral services. As word spread, people began to visit her studio out of curiosity. <span class='serif'>Soon she began recording their oral histories, collecting information about them, the local environment, the economy, and the history of the village. A complex portrait of Kitakama consequently emerged, leading her to believe: “Japan is in Tohoku.”</span>^^LIEKO SHIGA$$https://aperture.org/editorial/lieko-shiga-amanda-maddox/",
	    "<span class='question-1'>AR: As you mentioned before, the set-ups and processes that lead up to the moment when you take the initial photo are like a performance or ‘action’. Once you press the shutter, do you feel that you have captured a heightened state of reality?</span>LS: I think ‘action’ in photography is something to do with that sense of freshness: the photo shoot for My Husband in particular felt new and fresh to me. [...] My photographs render everything into reality: they are a way of bringing something back to life. You can talk about photographs in terms of ‘shooting’—to ‘shoot’ with a camera like you would shoot with a gun. <span class='serif'>However, for me, taking photos is not like shooting something: it’s like being shot.</span> I am shot, and the entire timeline of my existence is resurrected in the photograph. So, I think photography is the revival of eternal time and eternal life; <span class='serif'>a photograph is not a representation of time that has been killed. In such conditions, that means that I myself am firmly embedded in the photograph.</span>^^LIEKO SHIGA$$https://www.tokyoartbeat.com/tablog/entries.en/2008/10/ghosts-in-the-lens.html",
	    "NR: On the day that thousands of people were massing in front of the shrine during EDSA II [the Second EDSA Revolution; the first, also known as the People Power Revolution and commemorated by the shrine, had led to the Marcoses’ departure in 1986], we were supposed to open a solo exhibition by Santiago Bose in Green Papaya. We heard over the radio that thousands and thousands of people were already at the EDSA shrine. And Santiago said, “Hey, why don’t we cancel the opening and bring all the food to EDSA?” During that time, Surrounded By Water, another independent art space run by a collective of younger artists, was running a space right across the shrine. When we got to EDSA, bringing all the food from the opening, artists from our network were already there. Again, that was an action <span class='serif'>where artists were seen as important participants in that particular rally because artists had started to mobilise the immediate crowd</span> within the perimeter and started to solicit food, gather this food and distribute it to people. <span class='serif'>These are non-art-related actions, but nonetheless artists were there to make their presence felt as part of society and of the community.</span>”“In defining Green Papaya, Espina explained it carries the sense of not being yellow or ripe, and not to show something finished, and it encourages the state of potentiality, the state of being pure potential. It also gives encouragement to communities who are willing to experiment on different arts.”‘The communities they have created, advocacies they have supported, and voices they gave a platform to cannot be touched by flames; online, many have expressed their grief at the loss of a safe space, the loss of irretrievable works. “We have been getting a lot of encouraging messages from around the world,” says Espina. “These keep us and the team going. Green Papaya has had a hand-to-mouth existence for the past 20 years; money was always a problem. But it was this sense of community that kept us going this long, and we need our community now more than ever to help us piece back our history,” says Espina.’^^GREEN PAPAYA$$https://artreview.com/norberto-peewee-roldan-how-artists-can-change-society/",
	    "“...But besides the shared physical resources, <span class='serif'>the most valuable commodity is the presence and time we have for each other.</span> Green Papaya is sustained by a small community who like the kind of art that no one else thinks of as art—yet! It aspires to provide a space for critique and experimentation. Green Papaya has transitioned from being a space for exhibitions, to a discursive and performative space.”“Green Papaya is [...] is a halfway house for ideas, a space to hang out and have real conversations again, a chance to cook and share meals. <span class='serif'>It is less about art than it is about being artists and being human again—and questioning what that means in our current context.</span>”“Green Papaya is as much interdependent as it is independent. Green Papaya is not sustainable. <span class='serif'>Green Papaya is destined to close.</span> [...] By 2020, Papaya is no longer Green. It will be ripe and ready for the plucking.

	    "<span class='question-1'>CaroBD: Do you think that puppet art is in an ascension, or less popular - what do you think about the popularity of the medium?</span>JB: When I think about the history of the puppet medium, it sort of goes up and down sometimes. I think it's always there in one way or another, but public attention to it changes. Sometimes people discover it - 'Oh my gosh, it's puppets!' - like in the 1920s, 1960s, and 1990s in the United States [...] And then after a while people forget about puppets, and then rediscover them, as if its something brand new and not one of the oldest forms of performance in the world. [...] And right now, you know, thinking of Cirque du Soleil - which typically uses puppets, there's puppets on a lot of Broadway shows, [...] there's always been a lot of puppetry in television, in film, [..] puppetry goes into special effects. [...] And also traditionally, when you look at it you understand, puppets and objects are important for first nations culture and historically, Asian cultures - in India, and China, Japan and Indonesia, and all sorts of African forms of puppets and performance. <span class='serif'>It's a language that you can use,</span> and just jumping into that language is a very rich form.^^JOHN BELL$$https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/puppet-podcast/episode-20-john-bell-puppet-qWy6SjeoMK0/",
	    "1. Kedua, waktu tahun 2014 saya berkuda dari Pamulang, Tangerang Selatan ke Parompong, Bandung, lewat jalan kampung. Saya banyak dibantu anak-anak untuk menunjukkan jalan.
